jasmine rice,168877,"Rice, white, long-grain, regular, raw, enriched",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,85,80.26,"I adjusted for the major methodological difference: the USDA records are for raw rice while the EXPECTED values are consistent with cooked jasmine rice. I used a raw-to-cooked conversion factor of 0.35 (100 g cooked ≈ 35 g raw) — a commonly used estimate for rice yield — and compared scaled USDA values to the EXPECTED cooked jasmine values. Macronutrients (40% weight): - Calories: 364.96 kcal (raw) ×0.35 → 127.74 kcal vs EXPECTED 130 kcal. Tiny difference (~2.3 kcal, <2%) → very high similarity. - Protein: 7.13 g ×0.35 → 2.50 g vs 2.7 g. Small shortfall (~7.6%) → high similarity. - Carbs: 79.95 g ×0.35 → 27.98 g vs 28.2 g. Negligible difference. - Total fat: 0.66 g ×0.35 → 0.23 g vs 0.3 g. Small absolute difference (0.07 g). Overall macronutrient subscore is strong (~36.7/40). Vitamins & minerals (30% weight): - Vitamin A, C, D: EXPECTED = 0; USDA has no meaningful amounts → full similarity for these (no mismatch). - Calcium: 28 mg (raw) ×0.35 → 9.8 mg vs EXPECTED 10 mg. Very close. - Iron: 4.31 mg ×0.35 → 1.51 mg vs EXPECTED 0.2 mg. This is the largest single mismatch: enriched rice contains substantially more iron (enrichment/fortification), so iron is ~7.5× EXPECTED. That reduces this subscore. - Potassium: 115 mg ×0.35 → 40.3 mg vs EXPECTED 35 mg. Mildly higher. Net result: vitamins/minerals are generally similar except for iron (enrichment) → moderate subscore (≈24.8/30). Other nutrients (30% weight): - Dietary fiber: 1.30 g ×0.35 → 0.455 g vs EXPECTED 0.4 g (very close). - Total sugars: 0.12 g ×0.35 → 0.04 g vs EXPECTED 0.1 g (low absolute difference but relative) - Sodium: 5 mg ×0.35 → 1.75 mg vs EXPECTED 1 mg (small absolute difference) - Saturated fat: 0.18 g ×0.35 → 0.06 g vs EXPECTED 0.1 g (small) These items are close overall and do not drive large penalties. Overall reasoning: once raw-to-cooked scaling is applied, this USDA entry (enriched long-grain white rice) aligns well with EXPECTED jasmine rice for calories, protein, carbs and most micronutrients except iron (enrichment) and slightly higher potassium. The iron enrichment is the primary reason the score is not higher. Given the weighting (macros high, minerals moderate), this produces a strong similarity (score ≈80.26), corresponding to MID_CONFIDENCE (good match).",2,"rice jasmine, rice jasmine raw",2026-01-09T18:56:11.150027,0.413 g,,,,0.594 g,0.64 g,0.67 g,,,28.0 mg,1527.0 kJ,,,5.8 mg,0.22 mg,,,0.146 g,,1.3 g,,,,,,,223.0 µg,,1.389 g,,,0.325 g,,0.168 g,,4.31 mg,0.308 g,,,0.589 g,,,,0.258 g,25.0 mg,,1.088 mg,0.168 g,0.206 g,,,,,,,,4.192 mg,,,,,,,,0.381 g,115.0 mg,0.177 g,115.0 mg,0.335 g,7.13 g,,,,,,,,,,0.049 mg,0.18 g,15.1 µg,0.375 g,,,,,,,,,5.0 mg,,,,,,0.576 mg,0.255 g,79.95 g,0.66 g,0.12 g,,0.083 g,0.238 g,0.435 g,,,1.014 mg,0.164 mg,,,0.11 mg,0.1 µg,11.62 g,1.09 mg
