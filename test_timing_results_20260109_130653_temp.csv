capsicum,170108,"Peppers, sweet, red, raw",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,93,87.2,"Overall assessment: This entry (Peppers, sweet, red, raw) is an excellent nutritional match to the expected 'capsicum' profile. Macro-level match: Calories (26.53 vs 31) are within ~14% (small absolute difference ~4.5 kcal), protein (0.99 vs 1.0) effectively identical, total fat (0.30 vs 0.30) identical, and total carbohydrates (6.03 vs 6.0) essentially identical. Because core macronutrients are weighted highly (40%), near-exact matches here drive a high score. Vitamins/minerals: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, calcium, iron and potassium match the expected values exactly (or to practical measurement precision) — this is the strongest contributor to the high score in the medium-weighted vitamins/minerals category (30%). Vitamin D is 0 as expected. Other nutrients: Dietary fiber (2.1) and total sugars (4.2) match exactly. Saturated fat (0.06 vs 0.04) is slightly higher in the USDA value (50% relative increase) but absolute amount is tiny (0.02 g) and contributes only a modest penalty. Sodium (4 mg vs 2 mg) is double in relative terms, but the absolute difference is 2 mg which is nutritionally negligible for most uses; however the relative calculation reduces the other-group score slightly. Considerations: These readings are per 100 g raw sweet red pepper; varietal and ripeness differences can slightly alter sugar and vitamin C, but the red pepper result essentially embodies the expected 'capsicum' nutrient profile.

mozzarella,170847,"Cheese, mozzarella, part skim milk",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,95,81,"Summary: Overall this 'part-skim' mozzarella is a good nutritional match to the expected mozzarella profile (score ~81, MID_CONFIDENCE). Core macronutrients are tightly aligned: calories (254 vs 280, -9%), protein (24.3 vs 22.2, +9%), total fat (15.9 vs 17.0, -6%) and carbs (2.77 vs 2.2, +26%). The largest macronutrient discordance is carbs (+0.57 g) which is small in absolute terms given low-carbohydrate cheese, so macronutrient similarity remains high and contributes most to the score (core block ≈ 87% similarity → weighted contribution ≈ 34.9/40).

Micronutrients: mixed agreement. Calcium is substantially higher in this USDA entry (782 mg vs expected 505 mg, +277 mg, +55%), which is nutritionally meaningful (cheese is a variable but this is notably more calcium). Vitamin A is moderately lower (127 vs 183 mcg, -31%), iron is slightly lower (0.22 vs 0.30 mg, -27%), potassium is lower (84 vs 140 mg, -40%), and vitamin D is higher (0.30 vs 0.10 mcg) but still very small in absolute terms. Vitamin C is zero as expected. These mixed micronutrient differences reduce the medium-weight block (≈58% similarity → weighted ≈ 17.4/30).

Other nutrients: this entry aligns well on saturated fat (10.11 vs 10.6 g, -5%), sugars (1.13 vs 1.0 g, +13%), and sodium (619 vs 600 mg, +3%), and dietary fiber is zero as expected. These smaller relative differences keep the low-weight block strong (≈95% similarity → weighted ≈ 28.4/30).

Interpretation: the biggest practical differences are much higher calcium and somewhat lower potassium and vitamin A. The higher calcium likely reflects processing or milk-fortification/analysis differences and is not a negative for similarity but is a notable nutritional distinction.

red pepper flakes,170932,"Spices, pepper, red or cayenne",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,95,88,"Overall assessment: This USDA entry (Spices, pepper, red or cayenne — FDC 170932) is an excellent match for the expected nutritional profile for ""red pepper flakes"" on the core macronutrient side and a good match overall. Core macronutrients (40% weight): almost identical — calories 318.12 vs expected 317 (≈0.35% difference), protein 12.01 g vs 12.0 g (≈0.08% diff), fat 17.27 g vs 17.0 g (≈1.6% diff), and carbs 56.63 g vs 56.0 g (≈1.1% diff). Such tiny relative differences indicate a near-perfect match in the highest-weight category, contributing ~39/40 points. Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): mixed. Vitamin C, potassium and calcium are essentially identical (vitamin C exactly 76.4 mg; potassium 2014 vs 2010 mg; calcium 148 vs 144 mg), and iron is reasonably close (7.8 vs 8.9 mg, ~12% relative difference). However, vitamin A shows a large discrepancy: expected 16,200 µg vs USDA 2,081 µg — an ~87% relative difference that substantially reduces the score in this category. Vitamin D is effectively zero in both datasets (no meaningful content reported). Averaging these micronutrient similarities yields a solid but reduced subscore (~83/100 for this category), contributing ~25/30 points. Other nutrients (30% weight): mostly acceptable but with some differences. Dietary fiber is lower in the USDA item (27.2 g) than expected (34 g) — ~20% relative difference (meaningful for labeling and functional fiber content). Total sugars are higher in the USDA entry (10.34 g vs expected 7.5 g, ~38% relative difference)—this often reflects differences in drying/processing and residual sugar measurement. Saturated fat (3.26 vs 2.7 g) and sodium (30 vs 28 mg) are modestly different but not nutritionally consequential for a spice in typical culinary amounts. Averaging these other nutrient similarities yields ~79/100 for the lower-weight category, contributing ~24/30 points. Net score: combining the weighted contributions from macronutrients (~39.2), micronutrients (~24.9) and other nutrients (~23.6) gives an overall similarity ≈ 88/100. Significance of differences: the largest single issue is vitamin A: the expected value (16,200 µg) is much higher than the USDA value (2,081 µg). That difference could reflect an error or different reporting basis in the expected profile (for example, confusion between RE/RAE/IU units, use of different pepper varieties, or concentration assumptions). Despite that, for practical culinary and macronutrient substitution, the USDA dried spice entry is highly similar to the expected red pepper flakes profile. Acceptable variation notes: differences can arise from variety (cayenne vs other dried red peppers), drying method and degree, measurement/reporting units for provitamin A compounds, and whether values come from blended commercial flakes vs standardized spice samples. These explain most residual differences without negating the overall strong match.",1,peppers red flakes,2026-01-09T13:08:19.769053,,,,,,6.04 g,,,,148.0 mg,1331.0 kJ,,,51.5 mg,0.373 mg,6252.0 µg,,,,27.2 g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.8 mg,,,,,13157.0 µg,,,,152.0 mg,,2.0 mg,,2.75 g,,,,,,,,8.701 mg,,,,,,,,,293.0 mg,8.37 g,2014.0 mg,,12.01 g,,,,,,,,,,0.919 mg,3.26 g,8.8 µg,,,,,,,,,,30.0 mg,,,,,,0.328 mg,,56.63 g,17.27 g,10.34 g,,,,,2081.0 µg,,,2.45 mg,76.4 mg,,29.83 mg,80.3 µg,8.05 g,2.48 mg

I compared the USDA entry (Spices, bay leaf, FDC 170917) to the provided expected profile per 100 g. I weighted core macronutrients heavily (40%), key vitamins/minerals medium (30%), and other nutrients lower (30%). Core macronutrients (40% weight): - Calories: 313 vs 313.58 (diff 0.58; closeness ~99.8%). Negligible difference. - Protein: 6.8 vs 7.61 (diff +0.81; closeness ~88.1%). Small but meaningful proportionally (~12% higher in USDA). - Total carbs: 74.97 vs 74.97 (exact match; 100% closeness). - Total fat: 7.34 vs 8.36 (diff +1.02; closeness ~86.1%). Moderate proportional difference (~14% higher in USDA). Average closeness across these four ≈93.5% → contributes ~37.4 points to overall score. Vitamins & minerals (30% weight): I compared vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D (assumed absent in both), calcium, iron, potassium. - Vitamin A: 246 µg vs 309 µg (diff +63; closeness ~74.4%). Moderate difference. - Vitamin C: 3.0 mg vs 46.5 mg (diff +43.5; closeness effectively 0%). This is a major discrepancy: USDA reports very high vitamin C relative to the provided expected value. - Vitamin D: not provided in expected and effectively 0 in both datasets → treated as matching (100%). - Calcium: 1170 mg vs 834 mg (diff -336; closeness ~71.3%). Substantial but not enormous shortfall in USDA. - Iron: 9.45 mg vs 43.0 mg (diff +33.55; closeness effectively 0%). Very large difference; USDA iron is ~4.5× expected. - Potassium: 764 mg vs 529 mg (diff -235; closeness ~69.2%). Moderate difference. Average closeness across these six items ≈52.7% → contributes ~15.8 points to overall score. Other nutrients (30% weight): I used saturated fat, dietary fiber, and sodium (all available in both datasets). - Saturated fat: 2.03 g vs 2.28 g (diff +0.25; closeness ~87.7%). Small proportional difference. - Dietary fiber: 26.3 g vs 26.3 g (exact match; 100%). - Sodium: 44 mg vs 23 mg (diff -21; closeness ~52.3%). Sodium difference is moderate proportionally (USDA lower). Average closeness ≈80% → contributes ~24 points to overall score. Overall reasoning: The macro profile (calories, carbs, fat, protein) aligns very well — the USDA entry is an excellent macro match. However, key mineral and vitamin mismatches drive the score down: vitamin C and iron in the USDA record are dramatically higher than the expected values, while calcium and potassium are notably lower. These discrepancies are nutritionally important because iron and vitamin C differences change micronutrient contribution substantially; such differences could reflect analytic methods, different plant varieties, drying/concentration differences, or data-entry inconsistencies in one source. Saturated fat and fiber are well matched, and sodium is lower in the USDA entry. Given the mix of excellent macro agreement but several large micronutrient differences, the overall similarity is moderate but falls below the 'good' threshold (score 77 → LOW_CONFIDENCE).",3,"bay leaves dried, bay leaf dried raw, bay",2026-01-09T13:08:22.979889,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jasmine rice,,,,,,LOW_CONFIDENCE,search_below_threshold,,,"Best match found but nutritional similarity (55.4%) below 80% threshold. Summary: The USDA item (Rice, white, long grain, unenriched, raw — FDC 2512381) is a partial but imperfect match to the expected jasmine rice values (expected values look like cooked jasmine rice per 100 g). The biggest driver of mismatch is form (raw vs cooked) and concentration of macronutrients per 100 g. Detailed breakdown of the scoring follows. Macronutrients (40% weight) — calculated similarity ~34.4% (contribution ≈13.78 points): - Calories: USDA 369.64 vs expected 130 kcal (ratio ~0.352). This ~+240 kcal difference is large and is the dominant source of dissimilarity. Cooked rice contains much more water, so per-100 g calories are much lower than raw grain; comparing raw-to-cooked on a 100 g basis will therefore show large discrepancies. - Protein: 7.04 vs 2.7 g (ratio ~0.384). Higher in the raw sample due to concentration. - Carbohydrate: 80.31 vs 28.2 g (ratio ~0.351). Again concentrated in raw grain. - Total fat: 1.03 vs 0.3 g (ratio ~0.291). All four macro nutrients show similar directional differences consistent with raw vs cooked concentration; therefore macronutrient similarity is low and heavily penalizes the score. Vitamins/minerals (30% weight) — calculated similarity ~76.2% (contribution ≈22.85 points): - Vitamin A, C, D: both expected and USDA are effectively 0 — treated as matching (no penalty). - Calcium: 4.46 vs expected 10 mg (ratio ~0.446) — moderate shortfall in USDA white raw relative to expected. - Iron: 0.14 vs 0.2 mg (ratio 0.70) — modest shortfall. - Potassium: 82.26 vs 35 mg (ratio ~0.425) — higher in USDA raw; absolute difference is ~+47 mg. Overall mineral similarity is moderate because some nutrients match (zeros) and others differ but not catastrophically. Other nutrients (30% weight, lower weight) — calculated similarity ~62.5% (contribution ≈18.75 points): - Dietary fiber: 0.3 vs 0.4 g (ratio 0.75) — small difference. - Total sugars: typically very low in both (treated as matching). - Sodium: 0.46 vs 1 mg (ratio 0.46) — negligible absolute difference but ratio penalizes because expected sodium is extremely small. - Calories_from_fat: 9.30 vs estimated expected ~2.7 kcal from fat (ratio ~0.29) — difference reflects higher fat concentration per 100 g in raw grain. Net score and interpretation: summed contributions give a final similarity score ≈55.4/100. This places the match above the 50 threshold but well below the 80–90 bands. The low score is driven predominantly by macronutrient concentration differences caused by raw-vs-cooked basis (per-100 g raw grain contains roughly 2.5–3× the macronutrients of cooked rice because of the absence of water). If you compare on a dry-mass or cooked basis (convert raw to cooked weight or vice versa), the profiles would align much better; in other words, this USDA raw white long-grain rice is a plausible match to jasmine rice in composition by type (starch-dominant grain) but not by presentation (raw vs cooked). Confidence band: LOW_CONFIDENCE (poor match) given the numeric thresholds and large macro differences.",3,"rice jasmine, rice jasmine raw, grain rice",2026-01-09T13:12:21.501241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basmati rice,168877,"Rice, white, long-grain, regular, raw, enriched",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,75,80.2,"Summary and approach: The EXPECTED baseline for “basmati rice” (130 kcal /100g) aligns with a cooked-rice basis, whereas the USDA entries are raw (≈365–370 kcal/100g). I therefore scaled the USDA raw values by a factor so calories match expected (factor = expected_calories / usda_calories = 130/364.96 ≈ 0.3563). This gives an approximate cooked-equivalent comparison. Scoring used the requested weighting: macronutrients 40%, key vitamins/minerals 30%, other nutrients 30%. Per-nutrient similarity was computed as 1 - |(USDA_scaled - expected)| / expected (clamped to 0–1) and aggregated with the weights below.

Macronutrients (HIGH weight, 40%): After scaling, calories match by construction. Scaled protein = 7.13 * 0.3563 ≈ 2.54 g (expected 2.69 g) — a small shortfall (~5.6%); scaled carbs = 79.95 * 0.3563 ≈ 28.49 g vs expected 28.17 g (~1.1% high); scaled fat = 0.66 * 0.3563 ≈ 0.24 g vs expected 0.28 g (~16% low). These are small-to-moderate differences and yield a high macronutrient similarity (component score ≈ 37.7/40).

Key vitamins/minerals (MEDIUM weight, 30%): Vitamins A, C, and D are effectively zero in both datasets (match). Calcium in USDA (enriched) is 28 mg raw → scaled ≈ 9.98 mg (expected 10 mg) — essentially identical. Potassium scales to ≈ 41.0 mg vs expected 26 mg (≈58% higher than expected) — moderate difference. Iron is the major mismatch: USDA enriched raw iron 4.31 mg → scaled ≈ 1.54 mg vs expected 0.20 mg (many times higher because this is an enriched product) — large positive difference that reduces similarity for this category. Net result: medium-high similarity for this group (component score ≈ 22.1/30). The enrichment (added iron/calcium in the USDA product) explains the high iron and calcium numbers compared with plain basmati.

Other nutrients (LOWER weight, 30%): Dietary fiber scaled ≈ 0.46 g vs expected 0.4 g (close); total sugars scaled ≈ 0.043 g vs expected 0.05 g (close); sodium scaled ≈ 1.78 mg vs expected 1 mg (moderate difference higher in enriched product); saturated fat scaled ≈ 0.064 g vs expected 0.08 g (close). Overall these produce a good score in this bucket (component score ≈ 20.4/30).

Overall: Combining weighted components gives a final similarity ≈ 80.2/100. The strongest similarities are macronutrients and calcium; the main mismatch is iron (enriched product has substantially more iron than expected for plain basmati). The raw-vs-cooked scaling is the dominant adjustment—once accounted for, the enriched white long-grain rice aligns well with expected basmati values except for fortification-related minerals.",1,rice basmati raw,2026-01-09T13:16:53.312464,0.413 g,,,,0.594 g,0.64 g,0.67 g,,,28.0 mg,1527.0 kJ,,,5.8 mg,0.22 mg,,,0.146 g,,1.3 g,,,,,,,223.0 µg,,1.389 g,,,0.325 g,,0.168 g,,4.31 mg,0.308 g,,,0.589 g,,,,0.258 g,25.0 mg,,1.088 mg,0.168 g,0.206 g,,,,,,,,4.192 mg,,,,,,,,0.381 g,115.0 mg,0.177 g,115.0 mg,0.335 g,7.13 g,,,,,,,,,,0.049 mg,0.18 g,15.1 µg,0.375 g,,,,,,,,,5.0 mg,,,,,,0.576 mg,0.255 g,79.95 g,0.66 g,0.12 g,,0.083 g,0.238 g,0.435 g,,,1.014 mg,0.164 mg,,,0.11 mg,0.1 µg,11.62 g,1.09 mg
green lentils,168427,"Lentils, sprouted, raw",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,68,87,"Overview: USDA 'Lentils, sprouted, raw' (FDC 168427) is a close nutritional match to the provided expected values for 'green lentils' per 100 g, especially for the core macronutrients. Major contextual factor: the expected profile (116 kcal, ~9 g protein, ~20 g carbs) aligns with a cooked/sprouted/water-containing form rather than dry/raw lentils; the sprouted/raw USDA item is physiologically closer to cooked/sprouted values than dried/raw lentils, which explains much of the good agreement.

Macronutrients (HIGH WEIGHT, 40%):
- Calories: 106.12 vs expected 116 kcal (−8.6%): practically negligible for food labeling and recipe use; difference of ~10 kcal per 100 g is minor.
- Protein: 8.96 vs 9.02 g (−0.7%): essentially identical — no meaningful difference for protein contribution.
- Total carbohydrates: 22.14 vs 20.13 g (+9.9%): small absolute change (~2 g/100 g); not nutritionally large for most uses.
- Total fat: 0.55 vs 0.38 g (+0.17 g absolute, +45% relative): relative percent is large because values are very small in absolute terms; the extra ~0.17 g fat is nutritionally negligible.
These macronutrient comparisons are very close in aggregate; therefore the macronutrient component of similarity is very high and strongly supports a good match.

Vitamins/minerals (MEDIUM WEIGHT, 30%):
- Vitamin A: 2 vs 1 µg (+1 µg): negligible in absolute/physiological terms.
- Vitamin C: 16.5 vs 1.5 mg (+15 mg, +1000%): substantial difference. Sprouting commonly increases vitamin C vs cooked/non-sprouted lentils, so this is an expected physiological difference; it matters if you are using the lentils as a vitamin C source, but does not change macronutrient-based substitution. This is the single largest divergence in the micronutrient panel.
- Vitamin D: both effectively zero — matches.
- Calcium: 25 vs 19 mg (+6 mg, +32%): modest difference, low absolute impact.
- Iron: 3.21 vs 3.33 mg (−0.12 mg, −3.6%): essentially identical.
- Potassium: 322 vs 369 mg (−47 mg, −12.8%): moderate difference but not huge.
Overall, mineral profile (iron, calcium, potassium) is close; vitamin C is the notable outlier (much higher in sprouted). Given the mixed small-to-moderate differences, the vitamins/minerals component is a good but not perfect match.

Other nutrients / data availability (LOWER WEIGHT, 30%):
- Saturated fat: 0.06 vs 0.05 g (+0.01 g): negligible.
- Sodium: 11 vs 2 mg (+9 mg): small absolute difference but notable relative increase; still low-sodium food overall.
- Dietary fiber and total sugars: the supplied USDA sprouted record did not report dietary_fiber_g or total_sugars_g in the provided fields, so a direct comparison cannot be fully performed for these particular secondary nutrients. Typical sprouted lentil fiber is similar or slightly lower than cooked lentils on a 100 g basis; absence of that datum reduces confidence a little.
Because of the missing fields and a couple of small absolute differences (sodium), this category reduces similarity slightly but not substantially.

Integrated assessment and reasoning: strong alignment of calories, protein, and carbohydrates makes the sprouted/raw USDA item functionally interchangeable with the expected 'green lentils' values for most culinary and macronutrient-tracking purposes. The largest micronutrient discrepancy is vitamin C (sprouting raises vitamin C substantially). Minor differences exist in sodium, calcium, and potassium but these are moderate in absolute terms. Missing reporting for dietary fiber and sugars in the provided USDA entry prevents a fully comprehensive comparison but does not materially change the conclusion that this USDA item is a good match.

Conclusion: Given the very close macronutrient alignment, only one major micronutrient outlier (vitamin C), and only minor differences elsewhere, I assign a nutritional similarity score of 87/100 — a MID_CONFIDENCE (good match) result for the expected 'green lentils' profile. Use sprouted/raw lentils as a substitute, but note higher vitamin C and somewhat higher sodium in the USDA sprouted entry and verify fiber/sugar if those specific values are important for your application.",1,lentils green raw,2026-01-09T13:18:49.470541,0.356 g,,,,0.611 g,1.0 g,1.433 g,,,25.0 mg,444.0 kJ,,,,0.352 mg,,,0.334 g,,,,,,,,,,,1.258 g,,,0.319 g,,0.257 g,,3.21 mg,0.326 g,,,0.628 g,,,,0.712 g,37.0 mg,,0.506 mg,0.105 g,0.104 g,,,,,,,,1.128 mg,,,,,,,,0.442 g,173.0 mg,0.219 g,322.0 mg,0.356 g,8.96 g,,,,,,,,,,0.128 mg,0.057 g,0.6 µg,0.495 g,,,,,,,,,11.0 mg,,,,,,0.228 mg,0.328 g,22.14 g,0.55 g,,,,0.252 g,0.399 g,2.0 µg,,0.578 mg,0.19 mg,16.5 mg,,,,67.34 g,1.51 mg

cocoa powder,169593,"Cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,100,87.72,"Overall assessment: This USDA entry (Cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened; FDC 169593) is a good nutritional match to the expected 'cocoa powder' profile. The strongest alignments are carbohydrates, protein, and several minerals; the largest systematic difference is total energy (calories) and total fat (and therefore caloric density). Detailed analysis by component follows.

Core macronutrients (40% weight): The expected profile lists calories 378 kcal, protein 20.0 g, total carbs 57.9 g, total fat 22.5 g. The USDA item reports calories 227.5 kcal (-150.0 kcal, -39.8%), protein 19.6 g (-0.4 g, -2%), carbs 57.9 g (essentially identical), and fat 13.7 g (-8.8 g, -39%). Macronutrient similarity is high for protein (~98%) and carbohydrates (100%), but calories and fat are substantially lower (~60% similarity each). The net macronutrient subscore averages to ~79.8% and contributes ~31.9 points to the final score. Interpretation: the USDA powder is leaner and lower-calorie per 100 g than the expected values (likely due to differences in fat content or whether cocoa butter was largely removed), but protein and carb profiles are very similar.

Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): Expected: calcium 128 mg, iron 13.9 mg, potassium 1524 mg, vitamins A/C/D = 0. USDA values: calcium 128 mg (match), iron 13.86 mg (match), potassium 1524 mg (match), and A/C/D not reported (treated as 0). These are effectively identical to expected values, giving a near-perfect mineral match (~~100% subscore => ~30 points). Interpretation: mineral content strongly supports this being the same ingredient; matching potassium and iron are particularly informative for cocoa.

Other nutrients (30% weight): Important comparators are saturated fat (expected 13.0 g), dietary fiber (33.2 g), total sugars (1.8 g), and sodium (21 mg). USDA: saturated fat 8.07 g (-4.93 g, -38%), fiber 37.0 g (+3.8 g, +11%), sugars 1.75 g (very close), sodium 21 mg (exact). Similarity is high for fiber, sugars, and sodium, but saturated fat is notably lower (~62% similarity). The group average is ~86.0%, contributing ~25.8 points. Interpretation: fiber and sugars match closely; saturated fat is lower which aligns with the lower total fat and calories.

Overall synthesis: The high mineral agreement and strong matches for protein, carbs, fiber, and sugars outweigh the lower fat and calorie values; thus this entry is a good match but indicates a lower‑fat, lower‑calorie cocoa powder (likely a defatted or more highly pressed powder). Practical significance: for recipes or nutrient scaling, expect similar fiber and mineral content but lower calories/fat than the expected profile.
