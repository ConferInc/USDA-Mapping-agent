sherry,173176,"Alcoholic beverage, wine, dessert, sweet",SR Legacy,,search,MID_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_mid,88,89,"Closest overall match to sherry’s expected profile because it is a fortified dessert wine with comparable alcohol-derived calories and carbohydrate content. Core macronutrients (40% weight): calories are higher by ~18% (160 vs 136 kcal), consistent with slightly higher ABV/residual sugar; protein matches exactly (0.2 g); fat is effectively 0 g in wines; carbs are +14% (13.69 vs 12 g). This yields a strong macronutrient alignment aside from the modest calorie uptick. Vitamins/minerals (30%): vitamins A, C, D are effectively zero as expected; calcium and iron are lower than expected (8 vs 13 mg Ca; 0.24 vs 0.4 mg Fe), while potassium is slightly higher (92 vs 82 mg). These mineral shifts are typical variability across grape variety/fortification and are nutritionally minor compared with ethanol energy. Other nutrients (30%): sugars are moderately lower than expected (7.78 vs 12 g), suggesting this USDA entry represents a less-sweet dessert/fortified wine than the target sherry profile; sodium is nearly identical (9 vs 8 mg); fiber and saturated fat are 0 as expected. The main penalties come from sugars being ~35% below expected and calories being ~18% above expected; all other nutrients align closely or within plausible varietal/style variation for sherry.",1,wine sherry,2026-01-09T21:10:26.216147,,15.3 g,,,,0.3 g,,,,8.0 mg,671.0 kJ,,,5.0 mg,0.045 mg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.24 mg,,,,,,,,,9.0 mg,,0.119 mg,,,,,,,,,,0.213 mg,,,,,,,,,9.0 mg,,92.0 mg,,0.2 g,,,,,,,,,,0.018 mg,,0.5 µg,,,,,,,,,,9.0 mg,,,,,,0.018 mg,,13.69 g,,7.78 g,,,,,,,0.032 mg,,,,,,70.51 g,0.07 mg

Core macronutrients (40% weight): Calories 145 vs 145.55 (+0.4%), protein 1.0 vs 1.03 g (+3.0%), total fat 15.3 vs 15.32 g (+0.1%), carbs 3.8 vs 3.84 g (+1.1%). All differences are tiny and well within normal lab/rounding and brine/drain variability, yielding an excellent macronutrient match. Key micronutrients (30% weight): Vitamin A 20 mcg vs 20 mcg (match), calcium 52 mg vs 52 mg (match), iron 0.5 vs 0.49 mg (−2%), potassium 42 mg vs 42 mg (match). Vitamin C and D are expected 0 for brined olives; while not explicitly listed here, typical USDA entries for pickled green olives show 0 mg for both, so these are effectively matches. Other nutrients (30% weight): Saturated fat 2.1 vs 2.03 g (−3.3%), fiber 3.3 vs 3.30 g (match), total sugars 0.5 vs 0.54 g (+8% but only +0.04 g absolute—nutritionally negligible), sodium 1550 vs 1556 mg (+0.4%) consistent with brine strength and drain status. Fatty acid profile (high MUFA: 11.31 g) aligns with olives’ oleic acid–dominant profile typical of Castelvetrano. Considering acceptable variation due to cultivar, brining, and measurement precision, the profile is an almost exact match. Weighted scoring across groups yields ~98.6%, rounded to 99.",1,"castelvetrano olives, olives castelvetrano, olives green, olives green brine-cured",2026-01-09T21:37:35.702299,,,,,,4.53 g,,,,52.0 mg,609.0 kJ,,,14.2 mg,0.12 mg,9.0 µg,,,,3.3 g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.49 mg,,,,,510.0 µg,,,,11.0 mg,,,,11.314 g,,,,,,,,0.237 mg,,,,,,,,,4.0 mg,1.307 g,42.0 mg,,1.03 g,,,,,,,,,,0.007 mg,2.029 g,0.9 µg,,,,,,,,,,1556.0 mg,,,,,,0.021 mg,,3.84 g,15.32 g,0.54 g,,,,,20.0 µg,,0.023 mg,0.031 mg,,,3.81 mg,1.4 µg,75.28 g,0.04 mg

whole nutmeg,171326,"Spices, nutmeg, ground",SR Legacy,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,80,99.7,"Overall match is essentially exact. The USDA entry is for ground nutmeg, which on a 100 g dry basis is nutritionally equivalent to whole nutmeg; small lab/rounding differences are expected. High-weight macronutrients: calories differ by 0.14 kcal (524.86 vs 525; 0.03%); protein, total fat, and total carbs are identical (5.84 g, 36.31 g, 49.29 g). This yields a near-perfect macro match. Medium-weight vitamins/minerals: vitamin C, calcium, iron, and potassium are exact matches; vitamin D is expected at 0 and not reported by USDA for spices (assumed 0). Vitamin A is 5.0 mcg vs expected 1.5 mcg, a +3.5 mcg difference; while a large relative change to a very small baseline, it is nutritionally trivial (~0.4% of the 900 mcg DV) and within expected variability across datasets. Lower-weight others: saturated fat, fiber, and sodium are exact; total sugars are 2.99 g vs 3.04 g (−0.05 g; ~1.6% difference), well within analytical/rounding tolerance. Extra fatty acid details (MUFA/PUFA) and calories-from-fat provided by USDA align with expectations and were not penalized as they were not part of the expected set.

Vitamin D is not listed in the USDA record for spices, which is expected because cumin contains 0 mcg; treating it as 0 yields an exact match. Other nutrients (30% weight): Saturated fat 1.53 vs 1.54 differs by 0.01 g (≈0.6%), which is trivial and well within expected analytical/rounding variance. Dietary fiber 10.50 vs 10.5, total sugars 2.25 vs 2.25, and sodium 168 vs 168 match exactly. Additional USDA details (poly- and monounsaturated fat and calories from fat) are consistent with the totals and do not contradict expected values. Context and acceptability: The ingredient is ground cumin; the USDA item is cumin seed. Grinding the seed does not alter composition per 100 g, so near-identity is expected. All observed variances are negligible and attributable to rounding or typical data-source precision.

hot paprika,171329,"Spices, paprika",SR Legacy,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,88,98.6,"Spices, paprika aligns almost perfectly with expected hot paprika values across all categories. High-weight macronutrients: calories (+0.10%), protein (+0.3%), and carbs (-1.7%) are near-identical. Total fat isn’t explicitly listed in the USDA entry, but summing saturated + polyunsaturated + monounsaturated yields ~11.61 g vs expected 12.9 g (≈10% lower). This gap is plausibly due to unreported lipid fractions or rounding; paprika’s total fat often slightly exceeds the sum of fatty acid subtypes, so the effective total fat is likely very close to expected. Medium-weight vitamins/minerals match essentially exactly: vitamin A, C, D, calcium, potassium are identical; iron differs by only +0.2%. Lower-weight nutrients show minimal deviation: saturated fat is +1.9%, sugars +0.4%, fiber and sodium match exactly. Variety-related factors (hot vs sweet paprika) primarily affect capsaicinoids, not standard macro/micronutrient profiles; moisture and assay differences can also shift carb/fat marginally. Weighted scoring: macronutrients ≈97/100 (40% weight), vitamins/minerals ≈100/100 (30% weight), other nutrients ≈99.4/100 (30% weight), yielding ~98.6 overall.

The listed total fat (0.02 g) is clearly a data error for dark chocolate. Using energy balance (Atwater factors) to infer fat from calories, protein, and net carbs gives ~41.9 g fat/100 g, which is 13% above expected 37 g; saturated fat matches essentially exactly (22.03 vs 22). This yields a strong macro subscore. Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): Calcium (62 vs 60) and potassium (567 vs 560) are near-identical; iron is moderately lower (6.32 vs 9.0), which is plausible variance with cacao content and fortification. Vitamin A is a trace 3 mcg (expected 0), likely from formulation; vitamins C and D are not listed but are typically 0 in dark chocolate, aligning with expectations. Other nutrients (30% weight): Fiber is modestly lower (8 vs 10), sugars slightly lower (36.7 vs 40), sodium matches exactly (10 mg).

muscovado sugar,168833,"Sugars, brown",SR Legacy,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,88,99.9,"Overall assessment: HIGH_CONFIDENCE (excellent match). The USDA entry “Sugars, brown” aligns almost perfectly with the expected muscovado sugar profile, which makes sense because muscovado is essentially an unrefined brown sugar with retained molasses. Core macronutrients (40% weight): Calories are 380.02 vs 380 kcal (+0.02, ~0.005% difference, nutritionally negligible). Protein is 0.12 g vs 0 g; for sugars, trace protein is common and nutritionally negligible, and we treat small values near zero as essentially equivalent. Total carbs are 98.09 vs 98.1 g (−0.01 g, ~0.01% difference). Total fat is not reported but is typically 0 g in sugars; expected is 0 g, so treated as matching. This block is effectively a perfect match. Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): Vitamins A, C, and D are expected 0 and typically absent in sugars; USDA does not report values here, which is consistent with 0. Minerals match exactly: calcium 83 mg (vs 83), iron 0.71 mg (vs 0.71), potassium 133 mg (vs 133). This precisely mirrors the mineral footprint expected from the molasses content of muscovado. Other nutrients (30% weight): Sodium is identical at 28 mg (vs 28). Total sugars are 97.02 vs 96.2 g (+0.82 g, ~0.85% higher), a trivial difference within normal analytical and product-to-product variation. Dietary fiber and saturated fat are expected 0 and typically absent; not reported in USDA but treated as 0, consistent with sugar composition. Acceptable variation considerations: Muscovado vs generic brown sugar can vary slightly based on molasses retention and moisture; the observed tiny differences (trace protein, ~0.8 g sugar difference) are well within normal bounds for different brands/batches. Given the near identity across energy, carbs, minerals typical of molasses-bearing sugars, this result is an excellent stand-in for muscovado.",1,muscovado sugar,2026-01-09T23:56:58.256548,,,,,,0.45 g,,,,83.0 mg,1590.0 kJ,,,2.3 mg,0.047 mg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.71 mg,,,,,,,,,9.0 mg,,0.064 mg,,,,,,,,,,0.11 mg,,,,,,,,,4.0 mg,,133.0 mg,,0.12 g,,,,,,,,,,,,1.2 µg,,,,,,,,,,28.0 mg,,,,,,,,98.09 g,,97.02 g,,,,,,,0.132 mg,0.041 mg,,,,,1.34 g,0.03 mg

unblanched almond flour,2261420,"Flour, almond",Foundation,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,88,91,"Overall assessment: HIGH_CONFIDENCE match. The USDA item is nutritionally very close to unblanched almond flour, with the main deviations consistent with blanching/skin removal and methodological differences in fiber analysis. Weighted scoring (40% core macros, 30% key vitamins/minerals, 30% other) yields ~91/100. Core macronutrients (high weight, 40%): Calories are essentially identical (577.6 vs 579; −0.24%), and total fat aligns closely (50.23 vs 49.93 g; +0.6%), indicating similar lipid profile and no evidence of defatting. Protein is higher (+5.09 g; +24.1%) and total carbs lower (−5.30 g; −24.6%) in the USDA result; these shifts are typical for blanched almond flour (skins removed) where fiber and some carbohydrate decrease while the protein fraction appears higher by proportion. Despite these shifts, energy balance remains consistent, keeping macro similarity strong overall. Key vitamins/minerals (medium weight, 30%): Vitamins A, C, and D are expected to be 0 in almond flour; although not explicitly listed in the USDA record, typical nut flours contain negligible amounts, so these effectively match. Calcium (−13.6%), iron (−12.9%), and potassium (−9.0%) are modestly lower in the USDA item—again consistent with skin removal reducing mineral density. These differences are within acceptable variation for different milling and blanching. Other nutrients (lower weight, 30%): Dietary fiber is notably lower (9.27 vs 12.5 g; −25.8%), which explains most of the lower total carbs; this is the single largest non-macro discrepancy and aligns with blanched vs unblanched differences. Sodium is practically the same (0.89 vs 1 mg; −11% but trivial in absolute terms). Total sugars in almond flour are typically ~4.3–4.4 g/100 g and saturated fat ~3.8 g/100 g; while not reported in the USDA row, standard almond composition supports these values, matching the expected figures. Cross-check: calories from fat (USDA 452 kcal) equals 50.23 g × 9 kcal/g, confirming fat reporting integrity. Interpretation: The USDA profile likely represents blanched almond flour, while the expected values reflect unblanched (with skins). Differences in fiber, total carbs, and slightly lower minerals are therefore expected and do not materially change the overall nutritional identity.

sliced almonds,170567,"Nuts, almonds",SR Legacy,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,85,99.6,"This entry is an excellent match to the expected sliced almonds profile. Macronutrients: calories (579.11 vs 579), protein (21.15 vs 21.15), and carbs (21.55 vs 21.55) are identical within rounding. The reported total_fat_g = 0.00 is a clear data entry error; typical almonds contain ~50 g fat/100 g, and the listed fatty acid components (sat 3.80 g + mono 31.55 g + poly 12.33 g + trans 0.01 g ≈ 47.7 g) plus the correct energy (≈579 kcal) confirm fat is normal and within ~4–5% of expected (49.93 g). Key vitamins/minerals: calcium (269 mg), iron (3.71 mg), potassium (733 mg) exactly match; vitamins A, C, D are effectively 0 for almonds, aligning with expectations. Other nutrients: saturated fat (3.80 vs 3.802), fiber (12.5 vs 12.5), sugars (4.35 vs 4.35), and sodium (1 mg vs 1 mg) are effectively identical. Considering the obvious fat-field anomaly but corroborating evidence from fatty acid totals and energy, the overall nutritional profile matches sliced (i.e., raw) almonds extremely closely.
