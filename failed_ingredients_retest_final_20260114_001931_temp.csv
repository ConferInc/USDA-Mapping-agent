smoked paprika,171329,"Spices, paprika",SR Legacy,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,88,99.6,"Overall, this USDA entry for Spices, paprika is an excellent match to smoked paprika on a per-100 g basis. Method: compared nutrient-by-nutrient using weighted categories—macros (40%), key vitamins/minerals (30%), and other nutrients (30%). Macros (40% weight): Calories (282.27 vs 282) differ by 0.1%—negligible. Protein (14.14 vs 14.1) differs by ~0.3%—negligible. Carbohydrate (53.99 vs 54.0) differs by ~0.02%—negligible. Total fat is not explicitly listed in the USDA line, but summing fatty acid subtypes (sat 2.14 + poly 7.77 + mono 1.70) yields ~11.61 g, versus expected 12.9 g. The ~1.29 g remainder is typical for unclassified fats (e.g., other/unknown/trans) and rounding; paprika’s published total fat commonly aligns ~12.9 g. Considering this standard accounting gap, the effective fat match is strong; even if treated as a 10% difference on fat, macro similarity remains very high. Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): Vitamin A (2463 mcg), C (0.90 mg), calcium (229 mg), iron (21.14 mg), and potassium (2280 mg) match the expected values to within rounding (≤0.4% differences where non-zero). Vitamin D is effectively 0 in spices; although not explicitly listed here, it aligns with the expected 0. Other nutrients (30% weight): Dietary fiber (34.90 g) matches exactly; total sugars (10.34 vs 10.3 g) differ by ~0.4% (negligible). Sodium (68 mg) matches exactly. Fatty acid distribution (PUFA-dominant with modest SFA and MUFA) is consistent with paprika oil profiles. Acceptable variations: The USDA entry is generic paprika; smoked paprika is the same ground Capsicum annuum with smoke-drying. The smoking process minimally impacts macronutrients and minerals; small lab-to-lab differences and rounding explain the tiny discrepancies observed. Weighted result: macros ~98–99% (slight consideration for inferred fat), vitamins/minerals ~100%, other nutrients ~100%, yielding an overall similarity ~99.6%. Confidence: HIGH_CONFIDENCE (excellent match).",1,paprika smoked,2026-01-14T01:28:14.250340,0.64 g,,,,0.89 g,7.74 g,2.85 g,,,229.0 mg,1181.0 kJ,,,51.5 mg,0.713 mg,6186.0 µg,,0.23 g,,34.9 g,,,,,,,,,2.26 g,,,0.78 g,,0.25 g,,21.14 mg,0.57 g,,,0.92 g,18944.0 µg,,,0.69 g,178.0 mg,,1.59 mg,0.2 g,1.695 g,,,,,,,,10.06 mg,,,,,,,,0.61 g,314.0 mg,7.766 g,2280.0 mg,2.31 g,14.14 g,,,,,,,,,,1.23 mg,2.14 g,6.3 µg,0.61 g,,,,,,,,,68.0 mg,,,,,,0.33 mg,0.49 g,53.99 g,,10.34 g,,0.07 g,0.38 g,0.75 g,2463.0 µg,,2.51 mg,2.141 mg,0.9 mg,,29.1 mg,80.3 µg,11.24 g,4.33 mg
kosher salt,746775,"Salt, table, iodized",Foundation,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,88,98.4,"High-confidence match. Kosher salt is effectively pure sodium chloride with zero calories, fat, carbs, protein, sugars, and fiber; sodium ~39.3 g/100 g; other vitamins/minerals ~0. Weighted analysis: (1) Core macronutrients (40% weight): Iodized table salt provides 0 kcal, 0 g protein, 0 g fat, 0 g carbs (typical for salt) → perfect alignment, full 40/40. (2) Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): Vitamins A/C/D = 0 → perfect. Calcium 50 mg and potassium 2 mg are trace amounts likely from additives/processing; iron ≈ 0 mg. These small nonzero values slightly reduce this group’s score but remain nutritionally negligible relative to expectations for pure salt. (3) Other nutrients (30% weight): Sodium is the defining nutrient; 38,700 mg vs expected 39,300 mg (−600 mg, ~1.5% lower), which is within normal variability (crystal size, moisture, anti-caking). Dietary fiber and sugars are 0 → perfect. Net effect: macros perfect, sodium extremely close, only minor trace minerals present.

sea salt,173468,"Salt, table",SR Legacy,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,86,99,"Core macronutrients (40% weight): Sea salt contributes no calories, protein, fat, or carbs; table salt also contains none, so this category is a perfect match. Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): Expected sea salt has vitamin A, C, D at 0 (salt contains none), calcium 24 mg, iron 0 mg, potassium 8 mg. This entry matches calcium (24 mg) and potassium (8 mg) exactly, and vitamin A/C/D are effectively 0 for salt. The only deviation is trace iron at 0.33 mg vs expected 0 mg—an insignificant trace amount likely due to compositional traces or database rounding; nutritionally negligible and acceptable for different salt varieties. Other nutrients (30% weight): Sodium matches exactly at 38,758 mg per 100 g, which is the defining nutrient for salt. Other ‘other’ nutrients like sugars, fiber, saturated fat, cholesterol are inherently 0 in salt and align with expectations.

himalayan pink salt,173468,"Salt, table",SR Legacy,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,87,90.01,"Core macronutrients (40% weight): Expected 0 for calories, protein, total fat, and carbs; table salt provides 0 for all — perfect macro match (40/40 points). Key vitamins/minerals (30%): Vitamins A, C, D are 0 in both — perfect for those three. Calcium is much lower than expected for Himalayan pink salt (24 mg vs 160 mg, ~85% lower), iron is slightly lower (0.33 vs 0.4 mg, ~17.5% lower), and potassium is far lower (8 vs 280 mg, ~97% lower). Averaging these six yields ~66.7% for this category (~20.0/30 points). Other nutrients (30%): Sodium essentially identical (38,758 vs 38,800 mg, ~0.11% lower); saturated fat, fiber, and sugars are 0 as expected. This cluster is ~99.97% (~30/30 points). Overall, the result is driven by a perfect macro match and near-identical sodium (the dominant nutrient in salt), with predictable shortfalls in trace minerals due to table salt’s refining and lack of pink salt’s mineral content. Considering acceptable variation by source and processing, this is an excellent match to the functional nutrition profile of Himalayan pink salt.

flaky sea salt,746775,"Salt, table, iodized",Foundation,,search,HIGH_CONFIDENCE,search_verified_high,86,99,"Macronutrients (40% weight): Flaky sea salt is effectively pure sodium chloride with 0 calories, protein, fat, and carbs. Iodized table salt is the same in practice, so the macronutrient match is perfect. Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight): Expected A/C/D are 0; iodized table salt aligns (these vitamins are not present). Calcium is 50 mg/100 g versus expected 0—this is a small, trace-level amount for a 100 g basis and within plausible mineral traces seen across different salts. Potassium is 2 mg vs 0—negligible. Iron isn’t listed and can be treated as ~0, matching expectation. Other nutrients (30% weight): Sodium is 38,700 mg/100 g, exactly matching the expected 38,700 mg (primary defining nutrient for salt). Dietary fiber, sugars, and saturated fat are 0 as expected. Acceptable variation: The only notable divergence is trace calcium, which is nutritionally insignificant at this basis and consistent with minor mineral content that can appear in salts. Although this is iodized (adds iodine), iodine is outside the requested nutrient set and does not affect energy or macronutrient profile.
