capsicum,170108,"Peppers, sweet, red, raw",SR Legacy,,search,SUCCESS,search_verified,93,87.16,"Overall assessment: This entry (Peppers, sweet, red, raw) is essentially a nutritional match to the expected capsicum profile. Macronutrients: very close — calories (26.53 vs 31 kcal) are slightly lower (~14% lower), protein (0.99 vs 1.0 g) nearly identical, total fat (0.30 vs 0.30 g) identical, and total carbs (6.03 vs 6.0 g) effectively the same. These small macronutrient differences produce a very high macronutrient similarity score. Vitamins & minerals: essentially identical across the board — vitamin A (157 mcg), vitamin C (127.7 mg), calcium (7 mg), iron (0.43 mg), potassium (211 mg) all match the expected values; vitamin D is 0 in both. These identical micronutrient values drive a perfect (100%) similarity for the key vitamin/mineral category. Other nutrients: small differences exist — saturated fat is slightly higher (0.06 vs 0.04 g), and sodium is modestly higher (4 vs 2 mg). Dietary fiber and total sugars match. The small increases in saturated fat and sodium reduce the “other nutrients” subscore somewhat, but these are nutritionally minor for a fresh vegetable. Practical interpretation: nutritionally this USDA record is a direct match to the provided capsicum profile — differences are trivial and would not change dietary recommendations. The strong match also aligns with expected variation between batches/analysis methods. Because of this near identity, this record should be considered a high-confidence match to the ingredient “capsicum.”",1,peppers sweet,2026-01-09T00:40:53.400415,0.026 g,,,,0.036 g,0.47 g,0.284 g,,,7.0 mg,111.0 kJ,,,5.6 mg,0.017 mg,490.0 µg,,0.019 g,,2.1 g,,,,,,,,,0.211 g,,,0.028 g,,0.017 g,,0.43 mg,0.021 g,,,0.036 g,51.0 µg,,,0.036 g,12.0 mg,,0.112 mg,0.006 g,0.007 g,,,,,,,,0.979 mg,,,,,,,,0.05 g,26.0 mg,0.156 g,211.0 mg,0.024 g,0.99 g,,,,,,,,,,0.085 mg,0.059 g,0.1 µg,0.05 g,,,,,,,,,4.0 mg,,,,,,0.054 mg,0.04 g,6.03 g,0.3 g,4.2 g,,0.012 g,0.009 g,0.031 g,157.0 µg,,0.317 mg,0.291 mg,127.7 mg,,1.58 mg,4.9 µg,92.21 g,0.25 mg
mozzarella,170847,"Cheese, mozzarella, part skim milk",SR Legacy,,search,LOW_CONFIDENCE,search_low_confidence,95,83.0,"Best match found but nutritional similarity (83.0%) below 85% threshold. Overall similarity: High (83/100) but below the strict ""good match"" threshold (>=85%). Core macronutrients drive most of the agreement: calories (254.3 vs expected 280) and protein (24.26 vs 22.2) are close enough to keep the macronutrient subscore high. Detailed analysis:
- Core macronutrients (40% weight, subscore ~87.3): Calories are ~9% lower than expected, protein is ~9% higher, total fat is very close (15.92 vs 17.0, ~6% lower) and carbs are modestly higher (2.77 vs 2.2, ~26% relative difference). The differences are small-to-moderate in absolute terms for a cheese and give a strong macronutrient match overall.
- Vitamins/minerals (30% weight, subscore ~64.7): Mixed agreement. Vitamin A is substantially lower (127 vs 180, ~29% lower), vitamin D is slightly higher (0.30 vs 0.20, a small absolute increase but 50% relative), and calcium is much higher (782 vs 505, +55%). Iron and potassium are lower (iron 0.22 vs 0.3, potassium 84 vs 170). The very large calcium surplus and lower potassium are notable divergences: calcium can vary by processing/cheese concentration and lab methods; potassium differences are large enough to lower this component's score.
- Other nutrients (30% weight, subscore ~95.6): Strong agreement. Saturated fat is nearly identical (10.11 vs 10.6), sodium essentially identical (619 vs 620), dietary fiber expected 0 and reported 0, and sugars are close (1.13 vs 1.0). These small differences help raise the overall score.
Significance: The biggest biochemical/labeling impacts are the higher calcium and the lower vitamin A relative to the expected profile — these could reflect different production methods or compositional differences of part-skim vs a generic expected mozzarella. Macronutrient profile (calories/protein/fat) is quite similar, so for recipe/nutrition-calculation purposes this FDC entry is a reasonable match. However, because of the sizable calcium and vitamin A deviations, it does not meet the stricter >=85% ""good match"" cutoff.",3,"cheese mozzarella, cheese mozzarella raw, mozzarella",2026-01-09T00:42:36.925294,0.741 g,,,,1.042 g,3.27 g,1.757 g,,,782.0 mg,1064.0 kJ,,64.0 mg,15.4 mg,0.025 mg,,,0.144 g,,,,,,,,,,,5.677 g,,,0.464 g,,0.913 g,,0.22 mg,1.164 g,,,2.365 g,,,,2.464 g,23.0 mg,,0.01 mg,0.677 g,4.51 g,,,,,,,,0.105 mg,,,,,,,,1.266 g,463.0 mg,0.472 g,84.0 mg,2.498 g,24.26 g,,,,,,,,,124.0 µg,0.303 mg,10.114 g,14.4 µg,1.415 g,,,,,,,,,619.0 mg,,,,,,0.018 mg,0.924 g,2.77 g,15.92 g,1.13 g,,0.339 g,1.403 g,1.517 g,127.0 µg,0.82 µg,0.079 mg,0.07 mg,,0.3 µg,0.14 mg,1.6 µg,53.78 g,2.76 mg
