capsicum,170108,"Peppers, sweet, red, raw",SR Legacy,,search,SUCCESS,search_verified,0,92.16,"Summary of method: I compared the USDA item to the expected 'capsicum' values per 100 g across three weighted groups: core macronutrients (calories, protein, total carbs, total fat) weighted 40%, key vitamins/minerals (vitamin A, C, D, calcium, iron, potassium) weighted 30%, and other nutrients (saturated fat, dietary fiber, total sugars, sodium) weighted 30%. For each nutrient I computed a symmetric similarity = 1 - |observed - expected|/max(observed, expected) (treated 0 vs 0 as perfect match). Group similarities are the mean of nutrient similarities in the group, then weighted and summed to a 0–100 scale.
Detailed nutrient-by-nutrient analysis and significance:
- Calories: 26.53 vs expected 31.0 (≈14% lower). This is a small-to-moderate difference; calories contribute materially to the macronutrient group but the percent difference is modest, giving high similarity for the calories component.
- Protein: 0.99 vs 1.00 — essentially identical (negligible difference). Protein is not a major contributor per 100 g for capsicum, so near-equality is expected and helpful for similarity.
- Total fat: 0.30 vs 0.30 — identical. Because fat is low in capsicum, matching here prevents large penalties.
- Total carbs: 6.03 vs 6.0 — essentially identical (negligible). Carbohydrate match supports a high macronutrient score.
=> Macronutrient group is nearly identical and dominates the high score (group similarity ≈ 96%).
- Vitamin A: 157 vs 157 — identical (red pepper is the expected reference for vitamin A). This is a major positive for similarity because vitamin A was a key expected value.
- Vitamin C: 127.7 vs 127.7 — identical (very important micronutrient for capsicum; perfect match here strongly drives the vitamins/minerals group score).
- Vitamin D: both 0 — perfect match (capsicum is not a source of vitamin D).
- Calcium: 7 vs 7 — identical.
- Iron: 0.43 vs 0.43 — identical.
- Potassium: 211 vs 211 — identical.
=> Key vitamins/minerals are a perfect match across the board for this USDA entry, yielding a full score for that category.
- Saturated fat: 0.06 vs 0.04 (+0.02 g). Absolute difference is trivial in dietary terms; saturated fat is very low overall so this produces a small similarity penalty.
- Dietary fiber: 2.10 vs 2.10 — identical.
- Total sugars: 4.20 vs 4.2 — identical.
- Sodium: 4 mg vs 2 mg (+2 mg). Sodium difference is trivial in absolute terms (both extremely low). This yields a moderate minor penalty in the 'other' group.
Overall significance: nearly all reported nutrients are identical or extremely close; the only measurable offsets are tiny increases in sodium and saturated fat and a slightly lower calorie count. Because macronutrients and the key vitamin/mineral set match so well, the USDA item Peppers, sweet, red, raw is a near-exact nutritional match to the expected 'capsicum' profile and therefore scores very highly (≈92.2). Given the strict threshold, this is a 'good match' (≥85%).",1,peppers sweet,2026-01-09T00:26:56.353061,0.026 g,,,,0.036 g,0.47 g,0.284 g,,,7.0 mg,111.0 kJ,,,5.6 mg,0.017 mg,490.0 µg,,0.019 g,,2.1 g,,,,,,,,,0.211 g,,,0.028 g,,0.017 g,,0.43 mg,0.021 g,,,0.036 g,51.0 µg,,,0.036 g,12.0 mg,,0.112 mg,0.006 g,0.007 g,,,,,,,,0.979 mg,,,,,,,,0.05 g,26.0 mg,0.156 g,211.0 mg,0.024 g,0.99 g,,,,,,,,,,0.085 mg,0.059 g,0.1 µg,0.05 g,,,,,,,,,4.0 mg,,,,,,0.054 mg,0.04 g,6.03 g,0.3 g,4.2 g,,0.012 g,0.009 g,0.031 g,157.0 µg,,0.317 mg,0.291 mg,127.7 mg,,1.58 mg,4.9 µg,92.21 g,0.25 mg
mozzarella,170845,"Cheese, mozzarella, whole milk",SR Legacy,,search,LOW_CONFIDENCE,search_low_confidence,0,84.82,"Best match found but nutritional similarity (84.8%) below 85% threshold. Overall similarity: High but just under the strict 85% 'good' threshold. The whole-milk mozzarella (FDC 170845) aligns closely with the expected mozzarella profile for core macronutrients; calories, protein, fat and carbs are all within ~7–11% of the expected values. Detailed nutrient-by-nutrient reasoning:

Core macronutrients (40% weight; strong influence)
- Calories: 298.5 vs expected 280 (+6.6%). Small absolute difference; negligible for most recipe/labeling contexts. Contributes positively to the core score.  
- Protein: 22.2 vs 22 (+0.8%). Essentially identical — strong match.  
- Total fat: 22.1 vs 20 (+10.7%). Slightly higher fat (whole-milk variety), expected because this is whole-milk mozzarella. This makes it somewhat richer in energy from fat but still close.  
- Total carbs: 2.4 vs 2.2 (+9%). Minimal difference; negligible dietary impact.
=> Core average match ~93.2% -> contributes ~37.3 points to final score.

Key vitamins/minerals (30% weight; medium influence)
- Vitamin A: 179 vs 240 (−25%; meaningful drop). Whole-milk mozzarella has less vitamin A than the expected value; this is a moderate difference because vitamin A is fat-soluble and varies with milk fortification or milk-fat content.  
- Vitamin C: 0 vs 0 (match). Cheese is not a source of vitamin C.  
- Vitamin D: 0.4 vs 0.2 (+0.2 mcg; relative difference depends on small absolute values). Small absolute difference; modest effect.  
- Calcium: 505 vs 505 (exact match). Excellent agreement — important for cheese classification.  
- Iron: 0.44 vs 0.2 (+0.24 mg; ~higher). Cheese is a poor iron source; the small absolute difference is nutritionally insignificant.  
- Potassium: 76 vs 170 (−94 mg; large relative drop). This is the largest mineral mismatch. Potassium varies by cheese moisture and whey retention; low reported K in this USDA item reduces the mineral match score.
=> Vitamins/minerals average match ~69.1% -> contributes ~20.7 points.

Other nutrients (30% weight; lower influence)
- Saturated fat: 13.9 vs 12 (+15.8%). Whole-milk mozzarella has somewhat higher SFA, expected given full-fat milk. Moderately important for dietary fat quality.  
- Sodium: 486 vs 400 (+86 mg; +21.5%). Sodium is noticeably higher than expected; salt used in curd/whey processing varies by producer, and this difference is nutritionally meaningful for sodium-sensitive diets.  
- Total sugars: not explicitly listed in the USDA item but implied low (~~1 g) and consistent with expected 1.1 g; treated as a close match.  
- Dietary fiber: 0 vs 0 (match).
=> Other nutrients average match ~89.3% -> contributes ~26.8 points.

Interpretation and context: The whole-milk entry is clearly a close match to the expected mozzarella profile, especially for macronutrients and calcium. The principal deviations are higher sodium and saturated fat and a substantially lower reported potassium level. The potassium discrepancy likely reflects either analytic variation or differences between specific mozzarella types (low-moisture vs higher-moisture) and whey retention. Vitamin A is moderately lower, which is consistent with variability in milk fat and fortification. These differences are noteworthy for specific diets (low-sodium, low-saturated-fat, or where potassium content matters) but do not drastically change the classification of this product as mozzarella.",3,"cheese mozzarella, cheese mozzarella raw, mozzarella",2026-01-09T00:28:56.106506,0.707 g,,,,0.515 g,3.28 g,1.633 g,,,505.0 mg,1249.0 kJ,,79.0 mg,15.4 mg,0.011 mg,,,0.115 g,,,,,,,,,,,4.458 g,,,0.515 g,,0.515 g,,0.44 mg,1.135 g,,,1.826 g,,,,0.965 g,20.0 mg,,0.03 mg,0.515 g,6.573 g,,,,,,,,0.104 mg,,,,,,,,1.011 g,354.0 mg,0.765 g,76.0 mg,2.351 g,22.17 g,,,,,,,,,174.0 µg,0.283 mg,13.9 g,17.0 µg,0.735 g,,,,,,,,,486.0 mg,,,,,,0.03 mg,0.983 g,2.4 g,22.14 g,,,0.515 g,1.043 g,1.322 g,179.0 µg,2.28 µg,0.141 mg,0.037 mg,,0.4 µg,0.19 mg,2.3 µg,50.01 g,2.92 mg
red pepper flakes,170932,"Spices, pepper, red or cayenne",SR Legacy,,search,LOW_CONFIDENCE,search_low_confidence,0,83.0,"Best match found but nutritional similarity (83.0%) below 85% threshold. Overall assessment: The USDA entry 'Spices, pepper, red or cayenne' (FDC 170932) is a close match to the expected red pepper flakes profile for core macronutrients but shows meaningful differences in some vitamins and fiber. Macronutrients (high-weight, 40%): Calories, protein, total fat and total carbohydrate match extremely closely (all within ~0–1.6%), producing a near-perfect macronutrient subscore (~99/100). This means caloric and macronutrient-based uses (e.g., energy, protein/fat/carbohydrate budgeting) will be essentially interchangeable. Key vitamins/minerals (medium-weight, 30%): There are important divergences. Vitamin A in the USDA record (2,081 mcg) is far lower than the provided expected value (15,600 mcg)—an ~87% shortfall, which heavily pulls down this category. Vitamin C is higher in the USDA record (76.4 mg vs expected 35 mg), which also creates a mismatch in direction and magnitude. Calcium, iron and potassium are close (within ~1–12%), and vitamin D is effectively zero in both. Combining these yields a moderate minerals/vitamin subscore (~66/100). Other nutrients (lower-weight, 30%): Fiber in the USDA record (27.2 g vs expected 34.8 g) is lower by ~22% and total sugars are somewhat higher (~31%), while saturated fat and sodium are minor differences. These differences are nutritionally relevant for fiber- and sugar-sensitive formulations, giving an other-nutrients subscore of roughly 81/100. Net score and interpretation: Weighted combination of the three groups yields an overall similarity of ~83/100. This indicates a strong match for macronutrient-based substitution but notable deviations in vitamin A (very large), vitamin C (higher in USDA), and fiber (lower in USDA). Potential causes: varietal differences (cayenne vs specific red pepper flakes), drying/processing and seed/pith content, different analytical methods or reporting conventions (some datasets report vitamin A as RAE vs IU or include pro-vitamin A differently). Practical implication: Use FDC 170932 as a close nutritional proxy for red pepper flakes for calories/macros and for potassium/iron/calcium—but do not assume equivalence for vitamin A content or fiber without additional verification.",3,"peppers red flakes, crushed red pepper raw, spice pepper",2026-01-09T00:35:19.769387,,,,,,6.04 g,,,,148.0 mg,1331.0 kJ,,,51.5 mg,0.373 mg,6252.0 µg,,,,27.2 g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.8 mg,,,,,13157.0 µg,,,,152.0 mg,,2.0 mg,,2.75 g,,,,,,,,8.701 mg,,,,,,,,,293.0 mg,8.37 g,2014.0 mg,,12.01 g,,,,,,,,,,0.919 mg,3.26 g,8.8 µg,,,,,,,,,,30.0 mg,,,,,,0.328 mg,,56.63 g,17.27 g,10.34 g,,,,,2081.0 µg,,,2.45 mg,76.4 mg,,29.83 mg,80.3 µg,8.05 g,2.48 mg
